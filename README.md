# pug-mode

`pug-mode` offers Emacs support for [Pug](http://jade-lang.com/). Unlike
`jade-mode`, it is based off of
[slim-mode](https://github.com/slim-template/emacs-slim).

## Installation

`pug-mode` isn't available on MELPA yet. It won't be until it has been developed
and tested more comprehensively.

In the meantime, download `pug-mode.el` and insert the following into your
emacs.d:

```elisp
(require 'pug-mode)
```

## Why not use jade-mode?

I created pug-mode because [jade-mode](https://github.com/brianc/jade-mode)
(based on `sws-mode`) is incomplete in ways that are inconvenient to me. For
instance, it has poor/no fontification of plain-text, filter blocks, or mixin
definitions/invokations; its indentation strategies seemed too aggressive and
the source was too difficult to grok quickly to address these issues.

In contrast, it took me 10 minutes to grok `slim-mode`'s source and another 10
to adapt it to Pug in—what I think—is a better result. Most of the code is
lifted right out of slim-mode, so much of the credit belongs to its original
developers!
